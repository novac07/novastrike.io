      <h2> About the game </h2>
      Download Counter Strike 1.6 is one of the most popular and influential first-person shooter games ever created. CS 1.6 was 
      initially released for Half-Life in 1999. It soon became a huge success, gaining a passionate fanbase. Multiple sequels and 
      spinoffs were created in response to its success.
      <h2> Gameplay </h2>
        Download Counter Strike 1.6 is a multiplayer first-person shooter game. It pits two teams of players against each other: terrorists and counter-terrorists.
        The game is played in rounds, with each round lasting up to two minutes. The objective of the game depends on the game mode.
        Generally, one team tries to plant a bomb or defend hostages. The opponents are attempting to prevent the detonation of the bomb and rescue the people who have been taken hostage.
        Players start each round with a limited amount of money, which can be used to purchase weapons, equipment, and other items. The amount of money earned in each round depends on how well the player performed in the previous round. In addition to money earned from winning rounds, players can also earn money by completing objectives.
        One of the key features of CS 1.6 is its emphasis on teamwork and communication. Players must collaborate to reach their goals. Players can communicate with each other using in-game voice chat or text chat.
        The game includes a wide variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, rifles, and grenades. Weapons have different strengths and weaknesses. To succeed, players must learn how to use them effectively. For example, pistols are generally less powerful than rifles, but they are also faster and more accurate at close range.
        CS 1.6 includes a single-player campaign mode. In this mode, players can practice against bots in various scenarios. Multiplayer modes are also included.

          <li> Hostage Rescue: In this mode, the counter-terrorists must rescue hostages from the terrorists. The terrorists can use the hostages as human shields, making the rescue mission more challenging. </li>

      <h2>Counter-Strike Source</h2>
      <img src="counter.strike.source.x1.jpg" alt="CSSource.Image1">
      <h2> About the game </h2>
      Download counter strike source (CSS) is a first-person shooter game that was developed by Valve Corporation and released in 2004. It is the third game in the Counter-Strike series and is the successor to Counter-Strike 1.6. One of the most 
	  well-known online multiplayer first-person shooter games is CSS, which is a multiplayer game.
      <h2> Gameplay </h2>
    <p>
        The gameplay of Counter-Strike: Source is very similar to that of Counter-Strike 1.6.
        It is a team-based game where players take on the role of either a terrorist or a counter-terrorist.
        The objective of the game depends on the game mode being played, which include bomb defusal and hostage rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is played in rounds, and each round lasts for a certain amount of time.
        At the beginning of each round, players can purchase weapons and equipment using money that they have earned from previous rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS features a variety of weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles.
        In addition to weapons, players can purchase equipment such as grenades, kevlar vests, and helmets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Counter-Strike: Source also features a variety of maps, each with its own unique layout and design.
        Some maps are designed for bomb defusal, while others are designed for hostage rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key features of CSS is its physics engine, which allows for realistic physics and ragdoll effects.
        In other words, when a player dies, their body will fall to the ground and respond to its surroundings.
        The physics engine also supports destructible environments, enabling players to destroy barriers and other fixtures to forge new passageways or hide.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS also includes a number of custom options, including custom skins for weapons and players, custom maps, and custom game modes.
        There are also a number of community servers that offer unique game modes and features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conclusion: Counter-Strike: Source is a classic first-person shooter game that has stood the test of time.
        It offers a variety of weapons, maps, and destructible environments with a realistic physics system.
        If you have not played CSS before, it's definitely something that you should give a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS has been replaced in popularity by the newer Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).
        Despite this, there is still a loyal community of players who appreciate its gameplay and mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the main differences between CSS and CS:GO is the recoil system.
        In CSS, the recoil is much more predictable and easier to control, which some players prefer.
        CS:GO has a more difficult recoil to control than other games.
        This randomness adds an extra layer of challenge to the gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another difference between the two games is the graphics.
        CS:GO has updated graphics and a modern look.
        However, some players prefer the simpler graphics of CSS.
        They find these graphics more nostalgic and it adds to the overall experience of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS also has a vibrant modding community, with many mods available that add new weapons, maps, and game modes.
        Some of the most popular mods include Zombie Mod, Gun Game, and Surfing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zombie Mod is a game mode where players must fight against waves of zombies, who are controlled by other players.
        In "Gun Game" mode, gamers begin with a basic weapon.
        In order to advance, they need to overcome adversaries and gain access to a variety of weapons.
        In the game mode known as surfing, players attempt to complete the course by surfing on ramps and pulling off stunts.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS has also been used as a competitive game, with various leagues and tournaments held throughout its lifespan.
        Talented players still compete at a high level in CSS.
        However, it is not as popular for competitive play as CS:GO.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, CSS is a classic first-person shooter game.
        It has a dedicated community of players who enjoy its gameplay, mechanics, and graphics.
        It may not be as popular as CS:GO, but it still offers something for everyone.
        Casual players can enjoy it just as much as competitive ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS is an entertaining game.
        It has a wide range of maps, weapons, and game modes.
        You can play it for hours and not get bored.
        If you haven't played CSS before, it's definitely worth giving it a try.
